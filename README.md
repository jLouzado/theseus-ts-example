# "Seaworthy" Software

If you're a fan of "Shipping" (good code) then I think there's no better example than the [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) thought-experiment.
* This is the ultimate example of a Ship that keeps on sailing, continously facilitating the adventures of it's crew while being continously repaired and upgraded
* Wouldn't it be nice if our software behaved the same way? We could continously update it as we learned more about our Craft and our Customers

In that way the code would fit to us, rather than forcing us as humans (both developer and customer) rather than asking us to fit to the code.

Notes here: [Ship of Theseus > Bed of Procrustes](https://jlouzado.github.io/#Software%20should%20be%20a%20Ship%20of%20Theseus%2C%20not%20a%20Bed%20of%20Procrustes)

## Setup

```bash
yarn
yarn lint:deps
```

Try making changes to `utils-javascript.js` and `utils-typescript.ts`, try importing them back and forth and see what kinds of things you can try in each "space".
